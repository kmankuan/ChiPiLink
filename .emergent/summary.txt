<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to enhance their Chipi Wallet admin dashboard, with a focus on creating a unique and highly customizable user experience.

The scope of work in this session included:
1.  **Mosaic Community Landing Page:** Create a fourth, highly conceptual landing page that blends diverse themes: professional ping-pong, chess, kids playing/learning, Chinese culture, Panamanian culture, and Christian elements.
2.  **Customizable Navigation Icons:** Allow the navigation icons on this new page to be changed from the admin panel, supporting both pre-defined icon sets (Lucide) and custom image uploads.
3.  **New Top Section:** Replace the traditional header on the landing page with two new components:
    *   An ad/banner carousel at the very top, supporting rich text and image banners.
    *   A hero-sized media player below it that automatically plays content from a Google Photos album.
4.  **Monday.com Integration for Banners:** Create a workflow where banners are managed in a Monday.com board. The app should sync with this board, pulling Canva URLs for banner images and scheduling information (start/end dates).

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English and Spanish. You **MUST** continue to respond in English.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI project. The work in this session has significantly evolved the Mosaic Community landing page into a highly dynamic and admin-configurable module.

The following features have been fully implemented and tested:
1.  **Mosaic Community Landing Page:** A complete, functional fourth layout option is available, featuring a mosaic grid design.
2.  **Dynamic Banner Carousel:** The top of the page features a carousel that displays banners fetched from the backend. These banners are filtered based on their scheduled start and end dates.
3.  **Google Photos Media Player:** A large media player component is present, which automatically plays photos and videos from a Google Photos album URL configured in the admin panel.
4.  **Admin Showcase Module:** A new section in the admin panel allows administrators to:
    *   Manually create and edit rich text or image-based banners.
    *   Set the Google Photos album URL for the media player.
    *   Configure and trigger a sync with a Monday.com board to import banners.
5.  **Admin Layout Preview Module:** Another new admin section allows customization of the landing page's navigation icons, with options for Lucide icons or custom image uploads. The agent has already generated and applied a set of unique, AI-generated mosaic-style icons.
6.  **Monday.com Banner Sync:** The backend logic is in place to connect to the Monday.com API, fetch items from a specified board, map columns to banner properties (Canva URL, schedule dates), and save them to the database. The sync is currently triggered by a manual button press in the admin panel.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent completed the implementation of syncing banners from a Monday.com board, including handling Canva URLs and scheduling. This involved creating backend endpoints for the sync, updating the database schema to include scheduling fields, and building the UI in the admin panel for configuration and manual triggering.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?** N/A
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
None.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0 - Automate Monday.com Banner Sync:** The user approved the agent's suggestion to make the Monday.com sync automatic. The next step is to implement a recurring background job (e.g., using a scheduler like APScheduler or a simple timed task) that periodically syncs banners from Monday.com without requiring manual admin intervention.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **P1 - Evolve Mosaic Grid Layout:** The user has indicated that the grid layout on the Mosaic Community page will be changed in the future.
    *   **P2 - On-Demand Landing Page Redesign:** A previously deferred request to allow admins to request new landing page designs directly from the admin panel remains in the backlog.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:**
    - **Configuration-Driven UI:** The landing page is almost entirely rendered based on backend configurations for icons, banners, and media.
    - **Component Composition:** New features were built as distinct components (, ) and integrated into the main layout.
- **Backend:**
    - **Third-Party API Integration:** Expanded the existing Monday.com integration to sync and schedule content.
    - **External Data Fetching:** Implemented logic to fetch media from public Google Photos album URLs using .
    - **Content Scheduling:** The  endpoint filters banners based on  and , serving only the currently active ones.

**key DB schema**
- ****: (New) 
- ****: (New) 
- ****: (New) 
- ****: (New)  (Scoped to showcase feature)

**changes in tech stack**
- Added  to the backend  to make server-side HTTP requests.

**All files of reference**
-  (New API for all banner, media player, and Monday.com sync logic)
-  (New admin UI for managing these features)
-  (Primary landing page component)
-  (Admin UI for icon customization)
- 
- 

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The main  is getting crowded with tabs. It could be beneficial to refactor the admin navigation into a sidebar for better scalability as more modules are added.

**key api endpoints**
- : Fetches currently active (scheduled) banners.
- : Creates a new banner manually.
- : Manages the Google Photos album URL.
- : Manages Monday.com sync settings.
- : Manually triggers a banner sync from Monday.com.
- : Manages navigation icon settings for the layout.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Top Priority:** The immediate next task is to implement the user-approved enhancement: **automate the Monday.com banner sync**. This should be a recurring background job that runs periodically, removing the need for an admin to press the sync button manually. Consider using a library like  in the backend.
- **Content Workflow:** The established user workflow is **Canva (design) -> Monday.com (scheduling/URL) -> App (display)**. Respect and build upon this pattern.
- **Configurability First:** The user strongly prefers managing all aspects of the UI from the admin panel. Continue this approach and avoid hardcoding content or settings.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
