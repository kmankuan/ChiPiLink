<analysis>An analysis of the user's requests and the AI's actions has been completed. Here is the summary to assist the next agent.

**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to build a comprehensive admin dashboard for their Chipi Wallet application. The core requirements are:
1.  **Full 2-Way Monday.com Sync:** Establish a real-time, two-way synchronization between the application's wallet and a Chipi Wallet board on Monday.com. This includes creating user items on registration, creating transaction subitems, and processing top-up/deduction requests initiated from Monday.com via webhooks.
2.  **Admin Table Consistency:** Ensure all admin-facing data tables are standardized with a consistent set of features: mobile-first responsive design, global search, filtering, pagination, and bulk actions (archive, delete).
3.  **Full Internationalization (i18n):** The entire application must support three languages: English, Spanish, and Chinese (Mandarin).
4.  **Future Goal (AI-driven Parsing):** A backlog item to guide the user in setting up a Monday.com AI column to parse bank transfer notifications and automatically trigger the wallet top-up automation via the existing 2-way sync.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in both Spanish and English but has explicitly instructed the agent to **respond and write all code in English only**. The application itself must support English, Spanish, and Chinese.

**what currently exists?**
The application features a robust admin dashboard with a fully functional, tested, and idempotent 2-way wallet synchronization with Monday.com. A dedicated Sync Dashboard provides visibility and control over this integration. A major refactor has been completed to standardize all primary admin tables with a consistent, mobile-first design, including features like pagination, bulk actions, and search. An app-wide internationalization (i18n) effort is well underway, with ~82% of the frontend modules now supporting English, Spanish, and Chinese, and a language selector is present in the main admin header.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing the **P0 i18n Full Rollout**, aiming for 100% language coverage. It had successfully added translation keys and  hooks to 35 modules, bringing the total coverage to 82%. The work focused on the most visible admin areas like the main dashboard, integrations module, and the Monday.com Sync Dashboard.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (A comprehensive testing agent run confirmed the table consistency refactor and the initial i18n rollout were successful.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should be instructed to audit the application for any remaining hardcoded English strings in the UI and ensure they are correctly translated in all three languages (EN, ES, ZH).
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete P0 i18n Full Rollout (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The i18n coverage is at 82%. The agent needs to audit the ~20 remaining modules that lack i18n. The next steps are:
        1.  Identify all remaining hardcoded strings in the UI.
        2.  Add corresponding translation keys to the locale files ().
        3.  Apply the  function from  to replace the hardcoded strings in the relevant React components.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The application will be 100% internationalized, fulfilling a core user requirement and making it ready for a global user base.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    - **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P1 - Guide Monday.com AI Parser Setup:** The app-side webhook infrastructure is ready. This task involves providing clear instructions to the user on how to configure their Monday.com board to:
        1.  Use a Monday.com AI column to parse bank transfer alert text.
        2.  Extract the customer's email and the top-up amount into dedicated columns.
        3.  Use a status change automation to trigger the existing webhook, which will then process the top-up.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **P2 - Telegram Feed Visibility Controls:** Add admin settings to configure which user roles can view the integrated Telegram Community feed.

**Completed work in this session**
- **2-Way Monday.com Wallet Sync (DONE):** Successfully implemented and tested the full bidirectional sync, including user creation, transaction logging, webhook processing, and ensuring idempotency by tracking processed events in the database.
- **Monday.com Sync Dashboard (DONE):** Built a dedicated UI () and corresponding backend API () for monitoring sync status, viewing logs, and triggering manual re-syncs.
- **Admin Table Consistency Refactor (DONE):** Overhauled all major admin tables (, , , , , , , , ) to provide a consistent, mobile-first user experience with universal search, pagination, and bulk actions.
- **Redundant Feature Removal (DONE):** A Bank Alert Parser feature built in the admin panel was identified as redundant by the user and was completely removed from both the frontend and backend codebase.
- **Partial i18n Rollout (DONE):** Increased i18n coverage from 63% to 82%, added a language selector to the admin header, and translated all newly refactored table components and key admin modules.

**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI (MUI), TanStack Table, 
- **Integrations:** Monday.com (GraphQL API, Webhooks), Telegram Bot API
- **Architecture:** The agent enforced a highly reusable and consistent architecture.
    - **Frontend:** Standardized admin tables using shared hooks (, ) and components (, , ). Mobile-first design is now a standard.  is the standard for internationalization.
    - **Backend:** Utilizes an event-driven pattern for decoupling services (e.g., user registration event triggers Monday.com sync). A new DB model was added for webhook idempotency.

**key DB schema**
- ****: A new table managed via SQLAlchemy in  to ensure webhooks are only processed once. Columns: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) (PK),  (indexed).

**changes in tech stack**
None.  was already present but its usage was significantly expanded to become a core architectural component.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Adhere to User's Directives:** The user prioritizes engineering discipline.
    1.  **Language:** All code and agent communication **must be in English**. The app UI must support EN, ES, and ZH.
    2.  **Consistency:** New features must follow the established patterns for tables (mobile-first, pagination, etc.) and i18n.
    3.  **Proactive Engineering:** Act as a senior engineer by proposing well-structured, non-redundant solutions and applying principles like i18n globally.
- **Do Not Rebuild the Bank Parser:** The user's workflow for bank alerts is now entirely on Monday.com, leveraging the 2-way sync. Do not build any related parsing tools inside the app's admin panel.
- **Priority:** The immediate and highest priority is completing the P0 i18n rollout to achieve 100% translation coverage.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Running:** All services are operational.
*   **Broken:** None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Monday.com API v2 (GraphQL):** Requires a user-provided API key. Used for wallet sync.
*   **Telegram Bot API:** Requires .
*   **react-i18next:** Integrated for frontend internationalization.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES. The testing agent was used successfully after the 2-way sync implementation, Sync Dashboard creation, table consistency refactor, and the initial i18n rollout.
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** []
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. The agent uses keys provided in the environment.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent initially misinterpreted the bank alert parsing requirement and built a redundant feature, which was subsequently removed after user correction. The agent also initially failed to apply consistent engineering standards (table features, i18n), but this was corrected and became a primary focus of the work session.</analysis>
