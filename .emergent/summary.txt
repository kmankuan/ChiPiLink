<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to enhance their Chipi Wallet admin dashboard. The initial project scope included Monday.com synchronization, internationalization (i18n), and standardized admin tables.

The scope has since expanded to include:
1.  **Development Control Section:** An observability dashboard for developers, providing real-time system health monitoring, architecture visualization, dependency tracking, and an AI-powered development assistant.
2.  **AI Dev Helper:** An LLM-powered assistant (using GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4.5) integrated into the Development Control section. It has deep contextual knowledge of the application's architecture, database, and code to perform health checks, security audits, and offer strategic advice.
3.  **Automated Bank Transfer Processing:** A comprehensive system that automates the processing of bank transfer notifications received via email. The workflow includes:
    *   Real-time scanning of a configured Gmail inbox.
    *   AI-powered parsing (GPT-4o) of email content to extract payment details.
    *   A multi-layer deduplication engine to prevent duplicate transaction processing.
    *   Creation of pending transactions requiring admin approval.
    *   Synchronization of these tasks to a configurable Monday.com board.
    *   Admin controls for email filtering, Monday.com board/column mapping, and transaction approval/rejection.
4.  **Landing Page Redesign:** The user wants to replace the current landing page with a more modern and engaging design, and has requested multiple different design options to choose from.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English and Spanish. The agent should **continue to respond in English**.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a feature-rich admin dashboard with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. Key modules include:
1.  **Development Control Module:** A fully functional observability dashboard with live introspection into the app's architecture, APIs, database, dependencies, and Git history, along with the integrated AI Dev Helper.
2.  **Automated Payment Alerts Module:** A complete, end-to-end tested system for processing bank transfer emails. It features real-time background Gmail polling (with a configurable interval, defaulting to 1 minute), AI parsing, a robust deduplication engine, a queue for pending transactions, and a fully configurable two-way synchronization with Monday.com.
3.  **Telegram Community Feed:** An integrated feed with newly added role-based visibility controls, allowing administrators to configure which user roles can view the content.
4.  **Selectable Landing Page Designs:** The application's landing page has been refactored to support multiple, selectable design templates. Two new templates have been created:
    *   **Living Grid**: A modern, bento-grid style layout.
    *   **Cinematic**: A dark, editorial, full-screen image-based design.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user reviewed the second new landing page design (Cinematic) and requested the agent to create a third, completely different design option, while keeping the first two available as selectable templates.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N/A (Visual verification was done via screenshots).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** The  should be used to generate a new design concept. Implementation will be followed by visual verification using the  tool.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
None. All previously identified issues have been resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Create a Third Landing Page Design (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The user has requested a third, completely different design option. The next step is to call the  to brainstorm a new concept. After that, implement the design as a new React component (e.g., ) in  and add it to the  map in  to make it selectable.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will provide the user with another distinct design choice for the application's main landing page, fulfilling their request for multiple options.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via screenshot).
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P1 - User Chooses Final Landing Page Design:** After the third design option is presented, the user will need to choose which one they want to set as the default. The agent will then need to update the application's configuration accordingly.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   No outstanding future tasks have been identified from the PRD or user requests.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Monday.com Configuration UI (DONE):**
  - Integrated the  component into the Payment Alerts module.
  - Performed comprehensive backend and frontend testing to ensure admins can fetch boards, map columns, and save the configuration.
- **End-to-End Payment Alert Flow Verification (DONE):**
  - Conducted a full end-to-end test of the payment alert system: Gmail scan -> Pending Item Creation -> Monday.com Sync -> Approve/Reject -> Monday.com Status Update.
  - Fixed a status label mismatch (Rejected vs. Decline) to align with the user's Monday.com board configuration.
- **Telegram Feed Visibility Controls (DONE):**
  - Implemented an admin settings panel in the  to control feed visibility based on user roles (All Users, Admins Only, Specific Roles).
  - Added the necessary backend endpoints and permission checks. Tested with the testing agent.
- **Real-Time Gmail Polling (DONE):**
  - Corrected an earlier implementation by adding a true background polling service () for real-time email scanning.
  - Exposed polling status and interval configuration in the UI.
  - Set the default polling interval to 1 minute as requested by the user.
- **New Landing Page Designs (2/3 COMPLETE):**
  - Created and integrated two new, selectable landing page templates:  (bento grid) and  (dark, editorial).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:**  for creating persistent background services (Gmail Poller). Role-based access control (RBAC) extended to feature visibility.
- **Frontend:** Dynamic component loading based on configuration ( map). Advanced CSS for animations and modern layouts (CSS Grid, Flexbox, parallax scrolling).
- **Architecture:** Modular design continues to be extended with self-contained services like the . The frontend architecture now supports swappable UI themes/layouts for the landing page.

**key DB schema**
- : Modified to store  and .
- : Extended to store  for feed visibility.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-  (New file for the background Gmail scanning service)
-  (New file for the bento grid landing page design)
-  (New file for the cinematic landing page design)
-  (Modified to add role-based visibility controls)
-  (Modified to show Gmail poller status)
-  (Modified to add visibility control endpoints)
-  (Modified to manage the  lifecycle)
-  (Modified to support selectable layouts)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None critical. The landing page layout selection in  works but could be simplified if more layouts are added in the future.

**key api endpoints**
- : Returns the status of the background Gmail scanner (running, last scan time).
- : Gets the current visibility configuration for the community feed.
- : Sets the visibility configuration (allowed roles).
- : Lists all available user roles for the visibility configuration UI.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Top Priority:** The user is in a creative exploration phase for the landing page. Your immediate task is to generate and implement a **third, completely different** design style. Do not modify or delete the two existing templates ( and ).
- **All Core Features Complete:** All major functional requirements (Monday.com integration, real-time Gmail sync, Telegram visibility controls) are **implemented and verified**. The application is stable and the focus has shifted to UI/UX refinement.
- **Editable Admin Settings:** Remind the user that key parameters, like the Gmail polling interval, are fully editable from the admin dashboard and do not require code changes.
