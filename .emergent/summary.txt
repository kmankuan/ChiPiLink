<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially reported a bug where selecting more than two items in the Textbooks ordering workflow only registered two selections. After fixing this, the user requested a new feature: an Order Summary preview modal to be shown before submitting a textbook order.

The latest user request is to enhance the Telegram feed on the landing page. Specifically:
1.  When a single Telegram post contains multiple videos or a mix of photos and videos, they should be displayed as a single post/album on the frontend.
2.  This album should have navigation arrows to cycle through the media files.
3.  The admin panel should have new configuration options to change the title and UI of the Telegram feed container.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Bug Fix:** Resolve the multi-select issue in the textbook ordering workflow.
2.  **Feature:** Implement a pre-submission Order Summary preview modal.
3.  **Feature:** Enhance the Telegram feed to display media groups as a single, navigable album.
4.  **Feature:** Add admin controls for the Telegram feed container's title and UI.
5.  **Refactor:** Clean up unused files ().
6.  **Future:** Evolve the landing page layout.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English. You **MUST** continue to respond in English.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a stable full-stack React/FastAPI project.
- The critical bug in the textbook ordering workflow has been fixed. Users can now correctly select multiple available textbooks. Out-of-stock items are visually disabled and cannot be selected.
- A new Order Summary modal has been implemented. It appears before final submission in both the  and , showing the user a preview of their order.
- A new backend API () exists to manage the content of this summary modal, though no admin UI has been built for it yet.
- The codebase has been cleaned up by removing the obsolete  file.
- The Telegram feed currently displays posts but renders each media file as a separate post.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested a new feature for the Telegram feed: group multiple media files from a single post into a single, navigable album display. They also asked for more admin customization options for the feed's container.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** This is a frontend-heavy feature.
    1.  First, use  to inspect the data from the  endpoint to see how media groups are represented.
    2.  Modify the backend if necessary to pass a structured list of media.
    3.  Implement the album/carousel UI in .
    4.  Use the  tool to verify the new album UI and navigation arrows.
    5.  After implementation, use the  to run a regression test on the landing page and test the new admin configuration for the feed.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
None.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0 - Telegram Feed Album View:** Modify the Telegram feed to group multiple media files (videos/photos) from a single post into a unified album or carousel with navigation arrows.
        -   **Files to check:** , .
    -   **P0 - Telegram Feed Admin Configuration:** Create a new section in the admin panel to allow administrators to change the title and other UI aspects of the Telegram feed container on the landing page.
        -   **Files to check:** , .
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1 - Evolve Landing Page Layout:** Further refine the landing page design based on user feedback.
    -   **P2 - On-Demand Landing Page Redesign:** Allow admins to request new landing page designs from the admin panel.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Bug Fix - Textbook Multi-Select (DONE):**
    -   Fixed the logic in  and  to prevent the selection of  items and correctly count selected available items.
    -   Added a disabled state and an Out of stock badge for unavailable textbooks for better UX.
    -   Improved backend error handling in  to return clear warnings if a user tries to order an unavailable item.
-   **Feature - Order Summary Preview (DONE):**
    -   Created a reusable  component.
    -   Integrated the modal into  and  to show a preview before order submission.
    -   Created a new backend endpoint  to provide default configuration for the modal's content.
-   **Refactoring (DONE):**
    -   Deleted the unused and obsolete  file.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** A minor, pre-existing console warning about a unique key prop was observed during development. The agent noted it was not caused by the recent changes and did not block functionality.
    -   **Debug checklist:** Inspect the child components rendered within loops in  and  to ensure the top-level element of any mapped component has a unique  prop.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** Resolves a React warning and can prevent potential rendering bugs during list updates.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend.
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend State Management:** Using  to manage complex UI interactions like modal visibility, selection lists, and data for preview components.
-   **Conditional Rendering:** Disabling UI elements () and showing different components () based on data state (e.g., item availability).
-   **Modal Implementation:** Creating and integrating a reusable modal component () triggered by user actions before a final API call.
-   **API Error Handling:** Refactoring backend endpoints to return partial success/failure messages, and updating the frontend to display these messages to the user.
-   **Dynamic Configuration API:** Creating a backend endpoint to fetch UI configuration, allowing for future admin control without frontend redeployment.

-   : **(NEW)** Updates the order summary modal configuration (admin-only).
-   : **(MODIFIED)** Now returns warnings for partially failed updates.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your first task is to implement the **Telegram Feed Album View**.
-   **Implementation Plan:**
    1.  Start by investigating the current API response from . You need to understand how posts with multiple media files (media groups) are structured in the data received from the Telegram API.
    2.  Modify  to process these media groups. Instead of creating a separate post for each media file, it should return a single post object with an array of media URLs (e.g., ).
    3.  In the frontend, update . Add logic to detect if a post has multiple media URLs. If so, render a simple carousel/slider component instead of a single image/video.
    4.  Implement next/previous arrows for the carousel to allow navigation.
    5.  Once the album view is working, implement the second part of the request: add admin controls for the feed's title and UI. This will involve creating new endpoints in  and a new settings section in .
