<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to enhance the Chipi Wallet application. This session focused on a series of feature enhancements and significant refactoring, driven by user requests.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **UX Enhancement:** Implement native touch-swipe gestures for the landing page carousels.
2.  **UI Polish:** Add subtle slide-in/out animations to the landing page carousels.
3.  **Feature Enhancement (Telegram):**
    *   Fix the Telegram feed on the landing page to display video and photo posts, not just text.
    *   Allow videos to be playable directly in the feed.
    *   Create a backend configuration page in the admin panel to manage the Telegram integration (e.g., channel ID).
4.  **UI Enhancement (Landing Page):**
    *   Add a parallax scroll effect to the media player component.
    *   On mobile devices, make the banner carousel and media player full bleed (edge-to-edge) by removing horizontal padding and rounded corners.
5.  **Admin Panel Refactor (Major):**
    *   Reorganize the crowded admin navigation into a more scalable structure. This went through two major iterations:
        *   First, a two-level grouped sidebar navigation.
        *   Second, a final unified single-level grouped sidebar, absorbing all Administration sub-items into the main navigation for better performance and scalability.
    *   Add a search/filter input to the admin sidebar(s) to quickly find navigation items.
6.  **New Bug:** A newly reported bug where selecting more than two items in a UI component only registers two selections.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English. You **MUST** continue to respond in English.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a stable full-stack React/FastAPI project.
-   The public landing page features two carousels (Banner and Media Player) enhanced with touch-swipe gestures, slide animations, and a parallax effect on the media player. On mobile, these carousels are now full-width.
-   The landing page also includes a Community Channel card that successfully fetches and renders recent text, photo, and video posts from a configured Telegram channel.
-   The Admin Panel has undergone a complete architectural overhaul. The previous multi-level and tab-based navigation has been refactored into a single, unified, collapsible sidebar with hierarchical groups. This new sidebar is fully searchable.
-   A new backend API and corresponding admin UI exist to manage the Telegram integration settings.
-   An admin user () is seeded in the database to ensure login is possible in clean environments.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user reported a new bug with a screenshot, stating, more than 2 items selected, but only detect 2 items. The agent had just acknowledged the message and was about to begin its investigation.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual analysis. The agent must first ask the user to clarify which part of the application is affected by this bug, as the context is missing from the message history. Once the location is identified, the agent can use the screenshot tool to reproduce and verify the fix.
-   **User Testing Done:** N/A (User reported the bug)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Multi-select component only registers 2 selections (Priority: P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user reported that a component with a multi-selection feature is not working correctly. When they select more than two items, the UI or backend only seems to acknowledge two of them. The exact component and location are unknown.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **CRITICAL:** Ask the user to specify which page or component has this bug. Refer to the screenshot they mentioned.
        2.  Once identified, inspect the component's state management logic (e.g.,  hook managing the selected items array).
        3.  Check the event handler responsible for adding/removing items from the selection. It might be incorrectly overwriting the state instead of appending to it.
        4.  Verify if any  or similar logic is unintentionally limiting the array size.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a functional bug that prevents users from using a core feature as intended. Fixing it is critical for usability.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** Blocked on user clarification.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1 - Evolve Landing Page Layout:** Further refine the landing page design.
    -   **P2 - On-Demand Landing Page Redesign:** Allow admins to request new landing page designs from the admin panel.

None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Large-Scale UI Refactoring:** Deconstructing a complex, multi-level navigation system and rebuilding it into a unified, scalable, single-component structure ().
-   **Derived State Management:** Using  and component state to manage complex UI states like filtered navigation items based on a search query, and collapsible groups.
-   **CSS Animations & Transitions:** Implementation of keyframe-based animations for carousel slide effects.
-   **Responsive Design:** Adjusting component styles (, ) for specific breakpoints to achieve different layouts (e.g., full-bleed on mobile).
-   **Developer Experience:** Seeding a database with necessary data (like an admin user) to ensure a smooth and testable development environment from a cold start.

**key DB schema**

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The file  has had its logic and responsibilities moved to . It should be checked for any remaining imports and then deleted to clean up the codebase.

**key api endpoints**
-   : **(NEW)** Fetches Telegram configuration.
-   : **(NEW)** Updates Telegram configuration.
-   : **(MODIFIED)** Now returns posts with media URLs.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate and highest-priority task is to resolve the user-reported bug about the multi-select component.
-   **You are blocked.** The context for this bug is missing. Your first action **must** be to use the  tool to ask the user to specify which page/component the bug is on, and if possible, to re-upload the screenshot they mentioned.
-   The admin panel's navigation code in  is new and complex. The bug might be located there, or in one of the many configuration screens that were integrated. Be prepared to carefully trace state and props through this component.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (Updated multiple times)
-    (Final report for admin single-level nav)
-    (Final report for admin search & mobile padding)
-   Plus several other intermediate reports.
