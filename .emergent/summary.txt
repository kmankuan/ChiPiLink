<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was a microservices-ready architecture, which was completed. The focus then shifted to building out the Ranking Super Pin feature within a new  module.

After completing the initial feature, the user has requested a series of iterative enhancements:
1.  **Initial Enhancements:** Multi-language support, fixing a Create League button, allowing multiple check-in methods, adding a Back button, and improving player selection to include App users and a Monday.com board.
2.  **Code Consistency:** Renaming the frontend module folder from  to  to align with URL and API routes.
3.  **Feature P1:** Implementing full multi-language support and a player check-in system (Manual, QR, Geo).
4.  **Feature P2:** Implementing end-of-season tournaments with a bracket view.
5.  **Feature P3:** Creating a badge/achievement system that automatically awards players for accomplishments.
6.  **Feature P4:** Building a detailed Player Profile dashboard to display statistics and badges.
7.  **Feature P5:** Creating a multi-player comparison tool.
8.  **Feature P6 (Current):** Implementing a Torneo Relámpago (Lightning Tournament) for quick, automated matchmaking between checked-in players.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack modular monolith (React + FastAPI) with a consistent, microservices-ready architecture. The frontend and backend modules are both located under a  directory.

-   **Backend:** A robust  module contains all logic for the Super Pin feature, including services and repositories for leagues, matches, tournaments, player stats, and a new badge system. All API endpoints are prefixed with .
-   **Frontend:** The UI is fully integrated with the backend. It includes an Admin Dashboard, a Public Ranking view, League/Match details, a Player Check-in interface, a Tournament Bracket view, a detailed Player Profile page, and a Multi-Player Comparison tool. Full multi-language support (ES, EN, ZH) is implemented across all Super Pin components.
-   **Backend logic for Torneo Relámpago** has been initiated in .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the Torneo Relámpago (Lightning Tournament) feature, which was a suggestion from the agent that the user prioritized. The agent added the backend service method  to handle the core logic.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or bugs. The agent is currently working on a new feature.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Torneo Relámpago (Lightning Tournament) Implementation (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The backend service method  has been created. The next steps are:
        1.  **Backend:** Add a new API endpoint in  that calls this service method.
        2.  **Frontend:** Update the  component to include a button (e.g., Start Lightning Tournament) that becomes active when enough players have checked in.
        3.  **Frontend:** Implement the client-side logic to call the new endpoint and handle the response, likely navigating the user to the newly created matches.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** An engaging feature for quick matchmaking will be added, increasing user interaction as requested.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on something:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Task: Head-to-Head Match Predictor (P1):** Implement the user's suggestion to create a feature that predicts the winner between two players based on their ELO and historical performance. This would be a new component or integrated into the player comparison tool.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **Task: Advanced Statistics and Prize System:** Expand the prize system beyond badges to include configurable prizes for leagues/tournaments.
    -   **Task: Full Containerization:** When required, execute the plan to deploy each module as a separate container using the prepared  and  structure.

-   **Feature: Super Pin Initial Enhancements (DONE):** Completed the user's first three requests (multi-check-in, back button, enhanced player selection).
-   **Refactor: Frontend Folder Unification (DONE):** Renamed  to  and updated all associated imports for consistency.
-   **Feature: Full Multi-language Support (P1) (DONE):** Extended i18n to all Super Pin components.
