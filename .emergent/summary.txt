<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to enhance their Chipi Wallet admin dashboard. The scope has evolved from backend integrations (Monday.com, i18n) to significant frontend and feature development.

The current focus is on creating a unique and highly customizable user experience, primarily through a series of iterative landing page designs and the introduction of dynamic, admin-configurable UI elements.

Recent user requests include:
1.  **Multiple Landing Page Designs:** The user has requested several distinct landing page designs to choose from, providing specific creative direction and feedback for each iteration.
2.  **Dynamic Header Ticker:** Transform the static header into a configurable, scrolling ticker that displays real-time application activities (like new community posts or store orders) and sponsor messages.
3.  **Navigation Overhaul:** Remove the traditional top header navigation and consolidate all menu access into a persistent bottom navigation bar (), similar to a native mobile application.
4.  **Admin Customization:** A strong emphasis on making UI elements like landing page images and the activity ticker fully customizable from the admin dashboard without requiring code changes.
5.  **New Mosaic Community Landing Page:** A request for a fourth, highly conceptual landing page that blends diverse themes: professional ping-pong, chess, kids playing/learning, Chinese culture, Panamanian culture, and Christian elements. This design should break from traditional layouts (e.g., no hero section) and use a mix of cultural icons for navigation.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English and Spanish. The agent must **continue to respond in English**.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI project with a rich set of features, including a developer control panel, an automated payment alert system, and a Telegram community feed.

Recent additions include:
1.  **Selectable Landing Page Layouts:** Three distinct, admin-selectable landing page designs have been implemented: Living Grid (bento-box style), Cinematic (dark, editorial), and Horizon (light, modern).
2.  **Dynamic Activity Ticker:** A new  component is displayed at the top of the application. It's a scrolling banner that pulls real-time activity data from the backend (e.g., New post in Community) and is fully configurable from a new admin panel.
3.  **Native-Style Navigation:** The top header navigation has been completely removed. A persistent  is now the sole navigation element, visible on all screen sizes (desktop and mobile), providing a consistent, app-like experience.
4.  **Admin-Managed Content:** Both the  content and the main images on all landing pages are now dynamically fetched from a backend configuration, which can be edited by an administrator through a dedicated UI.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user requested a fourth, completely unique landing page with the theme Mosaic Community. This design should creatively fuse various elements (ping-pong, chess, kids, Chinese/Panamanian/Christian culture), avoid a traditional hero section, and use a mix of cultural icons. The agent acknowledged this highly creative request and began the process by generating the necessary images for this new concept.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?** The agent should continue generating images with the . After creating the new layout component, a  should be taken for visual verification.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
None. There are no outstanding bugs or technical issues.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Create a Fourth Landing Page Design (Mosaic Community) (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent has started generating images. The next steps are to:
        1.  Complete the generation of all necessary images that blend the requested themes.
        2.  Create a new layout component (e.g., ) in .
        3.  Implement the unique design as specified: no hero section, use a mix of visual blocks and custom icons to represent the different cultural and activity themes.
        4.  Register the new layout in  and the backend configuration to make it selectable by the admin.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will fulfill the user's request for a highly unique and culturally blended landing page, providing them with a fourth distinct design option.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via screenshot).
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P1 - User Chooses Final Landing Page Design:** After the Mosaic Community design is presented, the user will need to choose which of the four options to set as the default.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **P2 - On-Demand Landing Page Redesign via Admin:** The user expressed interest in a feature to request new landing page designs directly from the admin panel. This was deferred and should be kept in the backlog for future consideration.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Implemented Configurable Header Ticker (DONE):**
  - Created the  component to display a scrolling feed of real-time application activities.
  - Built the backend API (, ) to aggregate data and manage settings.
  - Added the  for admins to configure the ticker's data sources and sponsor content.
  - Enhanced the ticker to show source module badges (e.g., STORE, COMMUNITY) instead of generic dots.
- **Overhauled Main Navigation (DONE):**
  - Completely removed the top  navigation bar.
  - Promoted  to be the sole, persistent navigation element, visible on both desktop and mobile.
  - Consolidated all essential links (including Cart, Theme, Language) into the , eliminating duplicate links.
- **Created and Refined Third Landing Page (Horizon) (DONE):**
  - Developed a new light-themed Horizon layout.
  - Iteratively updated the design based on user feedback, including changing the hero image to one featuring professional Chinese kids playing ping pong with DHS branding, and removing all dark sections.
- **Implemented Admin-Customizable Landing Page Images (DONE):**
  - Created backend endpoints () to serve image URLs from the database.
  - Refactored all three landing page layouts (, , ) to fetch their main images dynamically from this configuration.
  - Added a UI in the admin panel for administrators to update these image URLs.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:**
    - **Component-based Architecture:** New features like  are encapsulated in their own components.
    - **Global Navigation:** The  component has been elevated to a global, persistent navigation element, fundamentally changing the app's UI structure.
    - **Custom Hooks:** The  hook was created to centralize and reuse the logic for fetching dynamic image configurations.
    - **Configuration-Driven UI:** The application heavily relies on fetching configuration from the backend to render UI elements, making it highly adaptable for administrators.
- **Backend:**
    - **Data Aggregation:** The  endpoint demonstrates aggregating data from multiple collections (community posts, orders) into a single, unified feed for the frontend.
    - **RESTful Configuration APIs:** New endpoints were created to allow the frontend to fetch and update UI configurations (ticker settings, image URLs) stored in the database.

**key DB schema**
- ****: (New Collection) Stores settings for the activity ticker, including its enabled state, data sources, and sponsor messages. 
- ****: (New Collection) Stores a mapping of image keys to URLs, used by the various landing page layouts. 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-  (New file for the third landing page design)
-  (New component for the top activity banner)
-  (New admin panel for Ticker and Landing Images config)
-  (New backend API for the ticker feature)
-  (Modified to only render the TickerBar)
-  (Modified to be the primary, persistent navigation)
-  (New custom hook for fetching landing page images)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The  now handles configuration for both the Activity Ticker and Landing Page Images. As more admin-configurable features are added, this module could be broken down into smaller, more focused configuration components (e.g., , ).

**key api endpoints**
- : Fetches the aggregated list of activities for the ticker bar.
- : Updates the ticker configuration.
- : Retrieves the URLs for all landing page images.
- : Updates the landing page image URLs.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Top Priority:** The user wants a **fourth**, highly creative and unique Mosaic Community landing page. This is not a standard design task. You must blend diverse and specific themes (Ping-pong, Chess, Chinese/Panamanian/Christian culture) into a novel layout that avoids conventions like a hero section. The agent has already started generating images for this.
- **Navigation is Finalized:** Adhere to the new navigation structure. The top header is for the ticker only; all user navigation happens through the persistent .
- **Everything is Configurable:** Do not hardcode content like images or ticker activities. All such content is managed via admin panels and backend configurations.
- **Creative Freedom:** The user has explicitly asked to be surprised and wants unique, native-app-like designs. Do not fall back on generic web layouts.
