<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to enhance the Chipi Wallet admin dashboard by creating a Mosaic Community landing page with a banner carousel and media player, allowing customizable navigation icons, and integrating with Monday.com to manage banner content.

Over time, the scope expanded to address several critical issues:
1.  UI bugs and a broken pay with wallet workflow on the textbook selection screen.
2.  A site-wide production loading failure that rendered the application unusable.
3.  A request to verify and fix two complex, two-way wallet top-up integrations with different Monday.com boards (Chipi Wallet and Recharge Approval).
4.  Most recently, a new issue where the main landing page is not displaying the banner ad and Google Photos album.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI project. The following work has been completed and verified:
-   **Production Server Hang:** A critical server-wide freeze caused by blocking synchronous I/O calls () in the Gmail service has been resolved by refactoring the code to be asynchronous using .
-   **Monday.com Wallet Integrations:** Two separate, complex integrations for wallet management have been fixed and verified.
    -   **Recharge Approval:** A missing webhook handler was created from scratch, enabling a complete workflow where status changes in Monday.com automatically credit user wallets in the application.
    -   **Chipi Wallet:** A hardcoded board ID was replaced with a dynamic lookup, making the integration more robust.
-   **Frontend Stability:** React Hook errors that were causing the frontend to crash have been fixed.
-   **Previous Fixes:** All previously reported issues with the textbook ordering UI and initial pay with wallet flow have been resolved.
-   **Testing:** The latest integration fixes were validated with the testing agent, which reported a 100% success rate across all tests.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user reported a new issue: the main landing page is not displaying the Google Photos album and the banner/text ad. The investigation has not yet started.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent. The investigation should start by taking a screenshot to confirm the issue, then examining the landing page's frontend component (e.g., ) and its corresponding backend data source () to diagnose why the content is not rendering.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Landing Page Content Not Displaying (Priority: P0 - CRITICAL)**
    -   **Description:** The user reports that two key features of the Mosaic Community landing page, the Google Photos album and the banner ad, are not visible on the production site.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This is a newly reported issue.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Take a screenshot of the landing page to visually confirm the missing elements.
        2.  Inspect the primary landing page component (likely  or similar) to analyze its data fetching and conditional rendering logic.
        3.  Use  to call the backend endpoint that provides data to this page (e.g., ) and verify the content of the response.
        4.  Examine the related backend logic in  to ensure data is being correctly retrieved from the database and serialized.
        5.  Check the  collection in the database to confirm that the expected banner and Google Photos configuration data exists.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This bug breaks the main user-facing landing page. Fixing it will restore core functionality and visual components of the application.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is the highest priority.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1 - Evolve Mosaic Grid Layout:** The user has indicated a future desire to change the grid layout on the Mosaic Community page.
    -   **P2 - On-Demand Landing Page Redesign:** A deferred request to allow admins to request new landing page designs directly from the admin panel.
    -   **P3 - Refactor AdminModule.jsx:** The agent previously noted that the admin module is getting crowded and could be refactored into a sidebar navigation for better scalability.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Production Server Hang Fix (DONE):**
    -   Identified and resolved a server-blocking issue in  by converting synchronous  calls to non-blocking with .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Asyncio in FastAPI:** Resolved a server-wide freeze by understanding and fixing the misuse of blocking I/O within an async event loop, using  as the solution.
-   **Webhook Implementation:** Architected and implemented a new webhook handler for a third-party service (Monday.com), including endpoint creation, business logic, and registration.
-   **Dynamic Configuration:** Improved integration resilience by replacing hardcoded IDs with dynamic API lookups.
-   **End-to-End Testing:** Systematically tested a complex multi-service workflow (App <> Monday.com <> Webhook) to validate functionality.

-    (New file for the fixed integration)
-    (File where the server hang was fixed)
-    (Latest test report showing successful integration tests)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The main admin UI () could be refactored from a tab-based layout to a sidebar for better scalability as more modules are added.

**key api endpoints**
-   : **(NEW)** Endpoint for Monday.com to trigger wallet top-ups.
-   : Fetches content for the main landing page (banner, Google Photos).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Your first and only task is to investigate why the landing page is not displaying the Google Photos album and banner ad. This is a critical user-facing bug. Follow the debug checklist provided in the All Pending/In progress Issue list section.
-   **Context:** The agent just completed a major effort to fix a server hang and two complex Monday.com wallet integrations. These fixes were tested and are considered stable. The new landing page issue is the current top priority.
