<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to build a comprehensive admin dashboard for their Chipi Wallet application. The core requirements were:
1.  **Full 2-Way Monday.com Sync:** Establish real-time, two-way synchronization with a Monday.com board.
2.  **Admin Table Consistency:** Standardize all admin-facing data tables with a consistent set of features (responsive design, search, filtering, pagination, bulk actions).
3.  **Full Internationalization (i18n):** The entire application must support English, Spanish, and Chinese (Mandarin).
4.  **Future Goal (AI-driven Parsing):** Guide the user in setting up a Monday.com AI column to parse bank transfer notifications and automatically trigger wallet top-ups.

A new requirement was added at the end of the session:
5.  **Development Control Section:** Create a section within the app to serve as a guide for future development. It should visualize the app's structure, outline core features, and document key architectural principles to ensure alignment for both the user and the agent.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English and Spanish. The agent should **continue to respond in English** as per prior user instructions.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a mature admin dashboard for the Chipi Wallet. It features a tested two-way Monday.com sync and standardized admin tables. The internationalization (i18n) system is now fully complete and covers 100% of the UI for English, Spanish, and Chinese.

The latest session added a sophisticated translation management suite, including:
*   A **Translation Coverage Card** on the admin dashboard that shows the completion percentage for each language.
*   A permission-gated **Dictionary Manager** module that allows admins with the correct role to perform inline editing, searching, and filtering of all translation keys.
*   An LLM-powered **Auto-Translate** feature (using GPT-4o) that allows authorized admins to automatically translate all missing keys for a language with a single click.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user requested a new Development Control section to be added to the application. The purpose of this section is to act as a living document and guide for future development, containing information on the app's structure, features, and principles. The agent received the request and was about to provide an opinion and plan.
- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. This task will likely involve creating a new page/module in the React application.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0 - Implement Development Control Section:** Design and build the new section requested by the user. This will involve proposing a structure for this information (e.g., a new admin page), gathering the relevant architectural details, and presenting them in a clear, accessible way within the app.
    *   **P1 - Guide Monday.com AI Parser Setup:** Provide the user with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to configure their Monday.com board to use an AI column for parsing bank transfer details and triggering the existing wallet top-up webhook.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **P2 - Telegram Feed Visibility Controls:** Add admin settings to configure which user roles can view the integrated Telegram Community feed.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Translation Management Suite (DONE):**
    - Built a  component to display i18n completion statistics.
    - Completely refactored  into a full-featured Dictionary Manager with inline editing and search capabilities.
    - Implemented a new  permission group (/) in the role system.
    - Protected all translation management features with role-based permissions.
- **LLM Auto-Translate Feature (DONE):**
    - Integrated OpenAI GPT-4o via .
    - Created a backend endpoint () to translate all missing keys for a specified language.
    - Added UI buttons for authorized users to trigger the auto-translation.
    - Successfully used the feature to bring Chinese language coverage from ~90% to 100%.
- **i18n Bug Fixes (DONE):**
    - Fixed a critical bug in  where navigation links would not re-translate when the language was changed, by correcting a  dependency array.
    - Replaced remaining hardcoded strings in various components.
- **Backend Auth Refactoring (DONE):**
    - Fixed an incorrect dependency injection pattern for permission checks in FastAPI routes to align with the project's existing auth structure.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Pydantic models, correct dependency injection patterns for auth.
- **Frontend:** React,  for internationalization,  for performance optimization, conditional rendering based on permissions, API integration with .
- **LLM Integration:** Using  to call  for text translation from a FastAPI backend.

**key DB schema**
- No direct database schema changes were made. However, the  enum within the  Pydantic model was updated to include a  group, extending the data structure for user roles.

**changes in tech stack**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** was introduced via the  library for the auto-translation feature.

**All files of reference**
- **New Feature Files:**
    - : Handles all i18n-related backend logic.
    - : The UI card for i18n stats.
    - : The modal for managing missing translations.
- **Heavily Modified Files:**
    - : Rewritten into an advanced dictionary manager.
    - : Extended role permissions.
    - : Corrected auth patterns.
- **Bug Fix:**
    - : Fixed language switching UI bug.

**key api endpoints**
- : Retrieves translation completion statistics.
- : Fetches all key-value pairs for the dictionary manager.
- : Updates a single translation string.
- : Translates all missing keys for a target language using an LLM.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Top Priority:** The immediate task is to address the user's request for a Development Control section. You must first propose a plan on how to implement this conceptual feature. This involves defining what information should be displayed (e.g., file structure, key components, API endpoints, design principles) and how it should be presented within the app.
- **User Expectation:** The user wants you to act as an expert with global vision. This means you should be proactive in your suggestions and provide clear reasoning for your architectural decisions.
- **Existing Systems:** The permissions system is robust. Any new admin feature should be protected by a corresponding permission check. The  hook on the frontend and dependency-injected checks on the backend are the established patterns.
- **LLM is Active:** The backend is configured with the  and can make calls to GPT-4o. This capability can be leveraged for future AI-powered features.
