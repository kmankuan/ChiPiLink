<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to enhance the Chipi Wallet admin dashboard. This session focused on several key issues and enhancements for the main public landing page:
1.  **Initial Bug:** The main landing page was not displaying the Mosaic Community banner carousel and media player.
2.  **UI Refinement:** The user requested multiple iterative changes to the banner carousel's navigation arrows to make them less intrusive.
3.  **Layout Redesign:** The user decided to remove the existing mosaic grid layout and replace it with a new card showing the latest posts from an integrated Telegram channel.
4.  **UX Enhancement:** The user approved the agent's suggestion to add native touch-swipe gestures to the carousels for better mobile usability.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English. You **MUST** continue to respond in English.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a stable full-stack React/FastAPI project. The main landing page has been significantly overhauled and now consists of three main components: a banner carousel, a media player, and a Telegram feed card.

-   A critical backend performance issue, where synchronous database calls were blocking the async event loop in the  module, has been proactively fixed by migrating the code to use the asynchronous  library.
-   To prevent the landing page from appearing broken on production environments with no data, frontend components now include default fallback content, and a backend database seeding function ensures default data is created on application startup.
-   The banner carousel's navigation arrows have been redesigned to be smaller, more transparent, and positioned in the corners to not obstruct the content.
-   The old mosaic grid layout has been removed and replaced with a Community Channel card that fetches and displays recent posts from the existing Telegram integration.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing native touch-swipe gestures for both the Banner Carousel and the Media Player to improve mobile user experience.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent. The agent should verify that swipe gestures correctly navigate the slides on both the banner and media player carousels in a mobile viewport simulation. A final screenshot would also be beneficial.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The work is focused on completing the in-progress feature enhancement.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Touch-Swipe Gesture Implementation (Priority: P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:**
        1.  The agent has started adding touch event handlers (, ) to . This logic needs to be completed and verified.
        2.  The same touch-swipe functionality must be implemented in the  component.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** Users on mobile devices will be able to swipe left and right on the banner and media player carousels, which is a more intuitive interaction than tapping small arrow buttons.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P1 - Evolve Landing Page Layout:** The user has shown interest in further refining the landing page design.
    -   **P2 - On-Demand Landing Page Redesign:** A deferred request to allow admins to request new landing page designs directly from the admin panel.
    -   **P3 - Refactor AdminModule.jsx:** The admin module UI is becoming crowded and could be refactored into a sidebar navigation layout for better scalability.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Landing Page Content Bug (DONE):**
    -   Diagnosed that the missing content issue was due to no data in the production database.
    -   Implemented resilient frontend components with fallback content in  and .
    -   Created a database seeding function in  to ensure default data exists on startup.
-   **Critical Backend Performance Fix (DONE):**
    -   Proactively identified and refactored the entire  module (, , , ) from synchronous  to asynchronous , preventing future server hangs.
-   **Landing Page Redesign (DONE):**
    -   Removed the mosaic grid from .
    -   Created a new public API endpoint  in .
    -   Built a new  component to display recent Telegram posts.
-   **UI/UX Refinements (DONE):**
    -   Iteratively redesigned the navigation arrows in  to be smaller, transparent, and positioned in the corners based on user feedback.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** The pattern of using blocking synchronous I/O calls within  functions was found again in the  module. The previous fork fixed this in .
-   **Recurrence count:** 1
-   **Status:** RESOLVED. The agent refactored the  module to use the async  library, resolving the recurrence.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Asyncio in FastAPI:** Reinforced the importance of using non-blocking libraries () within an async framework to prevent event loop blocking.
-   **Database Seeding:** Implemented a robust pattern for ensuring an application has default data on startup using an  operation, making deployments more reliable.
-   **Resilient Frontend Design:** Built components with fallback content to handle cases where API data might be missing, preventing a broken UI.
-   **Iterative UI/UX Development:** Responded to multiple rounds of user feedback to refine a component's visual design and user experience.

**key DB schema**

-    (In progress for swipe gestures)
-    (Needs swipe gestures implemented)
-    (Layout is complete)
-    (New component)
-    (New file for database seeding)
-    (Refactored to async)
-    (Modified for new public endpoint)
-    (Latest test report showing successful layout change tests)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The main admin UI () could be refactored from a tab-based layout to a sidebar for better scalability as more modules are added.

**key api endpoints**
-   : **(NEW)** Public endpoint that fetches the 3 most recent posts from the Telegram channel feed.
-   : Fetches banner content for the landing page.
-   : Fetches Google Photos album content for the media player.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate task is to complete the touch-swipe gesture implementation for the two carousels on the landing page ( and ). The foundation is laid in .
-   The major user-facing issues on the landing page have been resolved. The page is stable, redesigned, and resilient.
-   The backend has been made more robust by fixing another instance of blocking I/O calls.
