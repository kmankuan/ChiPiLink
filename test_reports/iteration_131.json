  "summary": "Frontend-only testing of Status Packs feature. All features working correctly: Progress Icons Gallery opens at /admin#layouts with expandable section containing 4 themes (Chinese Journey, Chinese Architecture, Celestial Path, Ink & Brush). Quick Apply Packs section shows 5 packs (Chinese New Year, Construction Progress, Nature Journey, Celestial Night, Calligraphy Master), each with 5 preview icons and 'Apply to Mosaic Community' button. Clicking apply updates icon animations via API - verified icons now have progress_journey_* animations. Students tab at /admin#unatienda works with compact table showing 27 students, Pre-sale column with toggle buttons, sortable headers (Student, Grade, School, Status, Pre-sale), pagination (25 per page), and search input. Landing page renders correctly with Mosaic Community layout.",
