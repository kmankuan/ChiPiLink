The code has robust autoplay logic with retries at 50ms and 300ms. API endpoint: /api/showcase/media-player returns 4 items.",

The w3schools test video (mov_bbb.mp4) returns MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR: Format error with networkState=3 (NETWORK_NO_SOURCE). This is not a code issue but an environment constraint. Both w3schools and commondatastorage.googleapis.com videos fail in headless Chrome. Portrait pairing issue (collecting ALL portraits) appears to be FIXED based on test results showing correct slide structure."
