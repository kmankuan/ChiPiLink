Dashboard displays all KPI cards (Products, Stock, Value, Alerts, Movements, Pending Orders), active alerts list, grade health bars, recent activity, and Quick Action buttons. Sidebar shows Dashboard as first item under SYSBOOK group. Unatienda StockOrdersTab cleanup verified - CatalogTypeSelector removed, public-only operations, subtitle mentions 'public store'. Backend stock-orders API uses catalog_type=sysbook (not pca).",
