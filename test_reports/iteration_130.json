Tab navigation reorganized from 10 flat tabs into 4 logical groups (CATALOG: Inventory/Public Store/Stock Mov, ORDERS: Textbook Orders/Access Requests, SCHOOL: Students/School Year, SETTINGS: Order Form/Config/Demo Data) with 3 visual dividers between groups. Inventory tab shows compact toolbar and inline stats instead of 6 stat cards. All filters (catalog type, search, grade, subject, status) work. Products table has sortable columns. Add Product button opens form dialog.",
